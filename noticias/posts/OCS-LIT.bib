The empirical analysis relies on the 2014/ 2015 data from the immigration module of the European Social Survey (ESS) for West and East European countries. We find that universalistic individuals expressed lower threat due to immigration and higher support of immigration while conservative individuals displayed the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediated the association between values and immigration attitudes, but in most countries the mediation was partial. The associations between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration were stronger in countries characterised by higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries characterised by higher levels of cultural embeddedness. The findings provide support for the centrality of human values in the formation of threat and attitudes towards immigration.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Although social integration has always been a~central sociological issue, there has never been a~consensus how to approach the topic empirically. In the new millennium, social cohesion has emerged as a~lead concept for measuring how integrated societies are---not the least, because many observers see the social fabric of modern-day societies in deep crisis. Consequently, scholars and think tanks have intensified their efforts to chart how strong the social glue of contemporary societies is, as well as which conditions strengthen or weaken it. The main goal of our article is to provide an overview of measures of social cohesion that have been specifically designed for cross-national comparisons. To this end, we compare selected measures with respect to what they measure, how, and for what purpose. We then highlight key empirical insights gained by these measures, touching upon the issues of levels, regimes, as well as determinants and outcomes of social cohesion. The review concludes that one of the measures, the Bertelsmann Social Cohesion Radar, stands out in terms of conceptual clarity, methodological sophistication, and richness of empirical findings.           ,              Zusammenfassung             Obwohl die soziale Integration schon immer ein wichtiges Thema der Soziologie war, gab es nie einen Konsens dar{\"u}ber, wie man sich dem Gegenstand empirisch n{\"a}hern sollte. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat sich daf{\"u}r der soziale Zusammenhalt als ein Leitkonzept herauskristallisiert~-- nicht zuletzt, weil viele Beobachter den Zusammenhalt heutiger Gesellschaften in der Krise sehen. Mittlerweile liegen mehrere Vorschl{\"a}ge vor, wie der gesellschaftliche Zusammenhalt gemessen werden k{\"o}nnte. Das Hauptziel unseres Beitrags ist, einen {\"U}berblick {\"u}ber ausgew{\"a}hlte Messinstrumente zu geben, die speziell f{\"u}r den internationalen Vergleich konzipiert wurden. In einem ersten Schritt analysieren wir, was genau die ausgew{\"a}hlten Messinstrumente wie und mit welchem Erkenntnisinteresse messen. In einem zweiten Schritt erl{\"a}utern wir die wichtigsten empirischen Erkenntnisse, die mit Hilfe dieser Messinstrumente gewonnen wurden, geordnet nach den Themen St{\"a}rke, Regime und Determinanten oder Folgen von Zusammenhalt. Unsere kritische Betrachtung kommt zu dem Schluss, dass der Bertelsmann Social Cohesion Radar hinsichtlich seiner Konzeption, Methodik und empirischen Anwendung gewisse Vorteile gegen{\"u}ber den anderen Messinstrumenten besitzt.},

Continued immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity have prompted this essential question for modern societies, but few clear answers have been reached in the sprawling literature. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust through a narrative review and a meta-analysis of 1,001 estimates from 87 studies. The review clarifies the core concepts, highlights pertinent debates, and tests core claims from the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust. Several results stand out from the meta-analysis. We find a statistically significant negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust across all studies. The relationship is stronger for trust in neighbors and when ethnic diversity is measured more locally. Covariate conditioning generally changes the relationship only slightly. The review concludes by discussing avenues for future research.},

Using data from the European Social Survey (2002--2018), we first show that a participation gap between pro- and anti-immigrant citizens exists for all types of political participation, even though the gap in voting is relatively small. The analyses also show that leftist and centrist anti-immigrant citizens participate less than leftist and centrist pro-immigration citizens, whereas their right-leaning counterparts participate almost as much in politics as do right-leaning pro-immigrant citizens. The observed participation gap points to the fact that there is a reservoir of anti-immigrant leftist and centrist citizens potentially waiting to be mobilized in many European countries.},

  abstract = {Negative (vs positive) intergroup contact may have a disproportionately large impact on intergroup relations because of valencesalience effects, whereby negative contact causes higher category salience (Paolini, Harwood, \& Rubin, 2010). One correlational and three experimental studies in three conflict areas (Northern Ireland, Arizona's border area, and Cyprus; Ns = 405, 83, 76, and 91) tested the moderation of these valence-salience effects by individuals' histories of outgroup contact. Consistent with a perceived fit principle valence-salience effects of face-to-face, television-mediated, and imagined contact held among individuals with negative or limited histories of outgroup contact; these effects were significantly reduced or nonsignificant among individuals with positive or extensive past outgroup contact. These moderation effects suggest that positive and diverse intergroup contact in the past buffers against the harmful effects of negative contact experiences in the present, thus limiting the potential for negative spiralling of intergroup relations.

In the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits. In the short run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital. New evidence from the US suggests that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods residents of all races tend to `hunker down'. Trust (even of one's own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer. In the long run, however, successful immigrant societies have overcome such fragmentation by creating new, cross-cutting forms of social solidarity and more encompassing identities. Illustrations of becoming comfortable with diversity are drawn from the US military, religious institutions, and earlier waves of American immigration.},

  abstract = {Integrated societies are typically said to be those where citizens engage with each other across racial, ethnic, and class lines, and where citizens have roughly equal expectations and likelihood of being successful in attaining the goods that society has to offer on fair terms. But the precise connection between trust and integration is only implied: sometimes, it appears, integration is regarded as a precondition for the development of trust and social cohesion in diverse societies, and at other times as its result. In this Special Issue, we target these specific lacunae, with contributions that address what social trust is and what role it can play in producing integration or a sense of belonging in democratic societies, and others which examine the sources of ongoing distrust in democratic societies that render a full integration difficult, if not impossible, under current circumstances. Taken together, the thesis of the contributions to this Special Issue can be understood as follows: while trust matters to democratic society, and conduces to the integration of its populace, more attention must be paid to the sources of distrust, and whether distrust can be undermined in ways that enable more and better integration in the future. In this introduction, we situate the contributions to the Special Issue inside of existing literature on, first, trust, and then second, on distrust.},
